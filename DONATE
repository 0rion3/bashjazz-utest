Other crypto-currencies or traditional international wire-transfers are
also accepted, but this has to be arranged. Please contact project maintainer(s)
for details: https://bashjazz.orion3.space/contact.html

If you donate, feel free to email and request a feature, a bug fix or anything
else related. I can't guarantee it, but since I've been working on this software
and using it myself for over a year I do think there must be people like myself
out there, who would find this tool immensely helpful. It's not going to
suddenly stop working - especially because it's just Bash scripts. So every
feature or bugfix added stays there for years to come without much need for
maintenance.
